Guess The Number generates a random number between 1 and 20 and the player must guess the right number in as few a guesses as possible.

This project uses simple DOM Manipulation in order to achieve it's purpose.

Note that the case when the player loses the game or any special case when there are no inputs have not been implemented and one can try these as exercises to test their understanding of DOM Manipulation basics.

The code has not yet been refractored nor commented as of now. This might change in the future.
